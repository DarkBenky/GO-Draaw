- [X] Implement bloom and other post-processing effects
- [ ] Optimize for speed
- [ ] Create flame graphs
- [ ] Trace rays to corners and draw triangles:
    - Create a box/cone representing the camera's viewing area
    - Find all triangles inside it
    - Order them based on distance
    - Draw them (consider adding shading based on normals)
    
- [ ] Fix ray tracer:
    - Fix uniforms ([link](https://github.com/tinne26/kage-desk/blob/main/docs/tutorials/intro/06_uniforms.md))
        - Note: Uniforms start with capital letters
